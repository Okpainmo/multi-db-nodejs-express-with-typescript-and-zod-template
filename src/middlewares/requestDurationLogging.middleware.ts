/**
 * Request Duration Logging Middleware
 *
 * This middleware tracks and logs the duration of each HTTP request processed by the application.
 * It measures the time between when a request starts and when it completes, providing
 * valuable insights into request processing times and potential performance bottlenecks.
 *
 * The middleware:
 * 1. Records the start time when a request begins processing
 * 2. Calculates the total duration when the request completes
 * 3. Logs both the start and end of each request with timing information
